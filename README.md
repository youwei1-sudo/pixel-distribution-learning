Motion Segmentation is the task of identifying the independently moving objects (pixels) in the video and separating them from the background motion.

Our work include use the state of the art : Pixel distribution model (random feature selection) to preprocess the extracted optical flow images. The extracted pixel distribution  would be serve as an input to our motion segmentation net.
